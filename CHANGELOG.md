# CHANGELOG.md

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(or Calendar Versioning where appropriate).

## How to update this file

- Only *important* changes go here (new game started, big shared code added, lobby progress, big refactor, etc.)
- We write in the **[Unreleased]** section until we decide it's time for a version (for example 0.1.0 when lobby + first few games work together)

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial monorepo structure with shared folders (`firstparty/`, `thirdparty/`, `assets/`).  
- Root documentation files: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, TODO.md, CodeStyleAndConventions.md
- Example sub-project folder (`sub-project-example/`) showing the structure we want for each game
- Basic legal files: LICENSE, NOTICE (for third-party code credits)

### Changed
- Updated root README with clearer explanations and Git commands suited for beginners
- Rewrote CONTRIBUTING.md with simplified workflow explanations, beginner-friendly Git command examples, and softer tone regarding code style consistency
- Updated CHANGELOG.md itself to better explain update rules and reflect documentation improvements
- Revised TODO.md wording to be more straightforward while keeping the task list intact
- Reworded CodeStyleAndConventions.md to clearly state it is a preferred style (not strict law), with invitation to discuss points that feel inconvenient

### Fixed
