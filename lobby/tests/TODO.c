 * @date 2026-02-18
 * @brief Placeholder file indicating that unit/integration tests are not yet implemented.
 *
 * This file exists solely to:
 *   - occupy the tests/ directory so it is not forgotten
 *   - serve as a visual reminder in project explorers / IDEs
 *   - document the current state of test coverage for this project
 *
 * Current status (as of last update):
 *   - No meaningful test cases have been written yet
 *   - Planned test areas (non-exhaustive):
 *     - Lobby player physics & collision (coyote time, jump buffer, multi-jump)
 *     - Circle-rectangle collision resolution edge cases
 *     - Skin selection menu interaction (mouse + keybinds)
 *     - Mini-game transitions (hitbox activation, init/cleanup)
 *     - Game state lifecycle (init -> loop -> free) for each sub-game
 *
 * Next steps / recommendations:
 *   - Replace or complement this file with actual test files (e.g. test_player.c, test_collision.c)
 *   - Aim for at least smoke tests on critical systems before adding new features
 *
 * Once meaningful tests exist, this file should either be:
 *   - deleted, or
 *   - renamed to tests/TODO_legacy.c and kept as historical reference
 *
 * Do not add real code here - this is intentionally a documentation-only placeholder.
