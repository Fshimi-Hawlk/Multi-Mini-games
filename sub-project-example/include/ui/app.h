 * @brief Public interface for drawing Game Name UI overlay elements (skin selection menu).
 *
 * This header declares the rendering functions responsible for the skin/character
 * selection interface that appears on top of the Game Name scene.
 *
 * All functions:
 *   - operate in **screen-space** coordinates
 *   - should be called during the UI render pass (after world rendering,
 *     typically inside BeginDrawing() / EndDrawing() but outside BeginMode2D())
 *   - perform no state changes - they are pure draw calls
 *
 * Longer description if needed (2–5 lines max):
 *   - What this file/module does
 *   - Key types/functions it exposes
 *   - Important constraints or usage rules
 *   - Cross-references to related files (@see ...)
 *
 * @note Any noteworthy limitation, future plan or non-obvious decision
 * @see ui/app.c                for implementation
 * @see `modulePath/moduleName` for [[`stuff that comes from the module`], ...]
